Data Analysis and Data Visualisation Projects 
<br>
<h2> NBA Rookies Data Analysis and Visualization </h2>
<br>
<p> For data analysis and visualisation which could help in predicting 5-Year Career Longevity for NBA Rookies by building Logistic Regression Model. As of now this NBARookies.ipynb focuses on the data analysis, visualisation and pre-processing for the NBA Rookies data </p>

<h2> Diabetes Disease Data Analysis and Visualization </h2>
<br>
<p> Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy. Early diagnosis can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment, by analysing and visualising the data we can contribute in the initial steps of making predictive models for diabetes risk important tools for public and public health officials. Diabetes_Disease_Data_Analysis.ipynb covers the data analysis, visualisation and pre-processing steps which would help us prepare the data and perform our EDA as well. </p>

<h2> FIFA Data Analysis and Visualization </h2>
<br>
<p> This fifa-data-visualization.ipynb file covers the data analyses, visualization and pre-processing of the FIFA dataset where I've tried to answer some of the questions via data analysis and data visualisation. The questions are mentioned in the notebook itself.</p>

<h2> Data Science Models for Automated Submission Triage of Motor Insurance Data in India</h2>
<br>
<p> This motor-insurance-classification.ipynb file covers the exploratory data analyses, visualization and real-time pre-processing of the motor insurance dataset using Kafka where I've tried to get the data insights via data analysis and data visualisation and have performed all the business transformations using KSQLDB queries and built different classification models to compare which is the best for this kind of data.</p>
